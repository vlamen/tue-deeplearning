    "What are Torch and PyTorch?\n",
    "\n",
    "[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) is an open-source Python library for deep learning developed and maintained by Facebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "The project started in 2016 and quickly became a popular framework among developers and researchers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Torch is an open-source project for deep learning written in C and generally used via the Lua interface. It was a precursor project to PyTorch and is no longer actively developed. PyTorch includes “Torch” in the name, acknowledging the prior torch library with the “Py” prefix indicating the Python focus of the new project.\n",
    "\n",
    "The PyTorch API is simple and flexible, making it a favorite for academics and researchers in the development of new deep learning models and applications. The extensive use has led to many extensions for specific applications (such as text, computer vision, and audio data), and many pre-trained models that can be used directly. As such, it may be the most popular library used by academics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The flexibility of PyTorch comes at the cost of ease of use, especially for beginners, as compared to simpler interfaces like Keras. The choice to use PyTorch instead of Keras gives up some ease of use, a slightly steeper learning curve, and more code for more flexibility, and perhaps a more vibrant academic community."
